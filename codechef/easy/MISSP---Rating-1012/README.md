Chef is fan of pairs and he likes all things that come in pairs. He even has a doll collection in which the dolls come in pairs. One day while going through his collection he found that there are odd number of dolls. Someone had stolen a doll!!!

Help chef find which type of doll is missing..

### Input

The first line contains an integer  **T**, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer  **N**, the number of dolls.
The next  **N**  lines are the types of dolls that are left.

### Output

For each test case, display the type of doll that doesn't have a pair, in a new line.

### Constraints

1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000 (10^5)
0<=type<=100000

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
