## Problem

### Gross Salary

In a company an emplopyee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of base salary and DA = 90% of basic salary.
If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the Employee's salary is input, write a program to find his gross salary.

 **NOTE:**  Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA

### Input

The first line contains an integer  **T**, total number of testcases. Then follow  **T**  lines, each line contains an integer  **salary**.

### Output

For each test case, output the gross salary of the employee in a new line. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than 10-2.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ salary ≤ 100000

    if salary < 1500:
        hra = salary * 0.10
        da = salary * 0.90
    else:
        hra = 500
        da = salary * 0.98
        
    gross_salary = salary + hra + da
    print(f"{gross_salary:.2f}")
```
