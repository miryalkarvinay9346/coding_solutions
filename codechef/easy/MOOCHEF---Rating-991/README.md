## Problem

### Moody Chef

Chef loves integers that are in the range of $l$ to $r$. More formally, Chef loves an integer $x$ if it satisfies the condition $l \leq x \leq r$.

Chef has an array $A$ of length $N$. Currently, the happiness of Chef is $0$.
He will examine the elements of the array in order from index $1$ to $N$.

If he finds an integer that he loves, his happiness will increase by $1$; otherwise, his happiness will decrease by $1$.
Find the values of  **maximum**  and  **minimum**  happiness Chef will experience while going through the array.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line of each test case contains three integers $N$, $l$ and $r$ — the number of elements in the array, the least number that chef loves, the biggest number that chef loves. The next contains $N$ space-separated integers, where the $i^{th}$ integer denotes $A_i$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, two space-separated integers denoting the maximum and minimum happiness Chef will experience.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq l \leq r \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2.5 \cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
4 1 3
4 3 2 1
2 5 5
1 4
```

```
2 -1
0 -2
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The first element is $4$. As $l = 1$ and $r = 3$, this number makes chef sad, hence his happiness decreases by $1$. After this all three elements increases the chef's happiness. Hence, the maximum happiness is $2$, whereas the minimum happiness is $-1$.

 **Test case $2$:**  As $l = r = 5$, neither of the elements of the array will increase chef's happiness. Hence maximum happiness equals $0$ (which was his happiness initially) and minimum happiness equals $-2$.

```py
# cook your dish here
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n,l,r=map(int,input().split())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    c,hmax,hmin=0,0,0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i]>=l and a[i]<=r:
            c+=1
        else:
            c-=1
        if c>hmax:
            hmax=c
        if c<hmin:
            hmin=c
    print(hmax,hmin)
    
```
