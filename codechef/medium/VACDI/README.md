## Problem

### Vaccine Distribution

A doctor has received a batch of vaccines to treat $N$ infected patients. The strength of each vaccine and the infection level of each patient are represented by two arrays.

You are given an array $V$ of size $N$, where $V_i$ denotes the strength of the $i^{th}$ vaccine, and an array $P$ of size $N$, where $P_i$ denotes the infection level of the $i^{th}$ patient.

Each vaccine can be assigned to  **exactly one**  patient, and each patient must receive  **exactly one**  vaccine.

A patient is cured only if the assigned vaccine has  **strictly greater**  strength than the patient's infection level.

Determine whether it is possible to assign the vaccines so that  **every patient is cured**.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the array $V$.
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the array $P$.
### Output Format

Print `Yes` if all patients can be cured; otherwise, print `No`.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le V_i \le 10^4$
- $1 \le P_i \le 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
123 146 454 542 456
100 328 248 689 200
```

```
No
```

### Explanation:

No assignment of vaccines can cure the patient with infection level $689$, since every available vaccine has strength less than or equal to $689$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
4
300 200 250 320
120 230 180 270
```

```
Yes
```

### Explanation:

One possible assignment is:

- Vaccine 200 $\rightarrow$ Patient 180
- Vaccine 250 $\rightarrow$ Patient 230
- Vaccine 300 $\rightarrow$ Patient 270
- Vaccine 320 $\rightarrow$ Patient 120

Each assigned vaccine has strictly greater strength than the corresponding patient's infection level.
