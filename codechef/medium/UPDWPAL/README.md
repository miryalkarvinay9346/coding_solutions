## Problem

### Up-Down Palindrome

You're given an array $A$ of length $N$.

You can perform the following operation on it:

- Choose an integer $X$.
- Then, for each index $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), If $A_i \le X$, add $1$ to $A_i$. Otherwise, subtract $1$ from $A_i$.

For example, if $A = [2, 6, 3, 4, 3]$ and you choose $X = 3$, the array becomes $[3, 5, 4, 3, 4]$.

You can perform this operation  **at most once**, but you are free to choose whichever value of $X$ you want.

Is it possible to turn the array $A$ into a palindrome by performing this operation  **at most once** ?

Note that the array $A$ is called a palindrome if and only if $A_i = A_{N+1-i}$ for each $1 \le i \le N$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the length of the array. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: `Yes` if the array can be turned into a palindrome, and `No` otherwise.

Each character of the output can be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e. the strings `NO`, `No`, `nO`, and `no` will be considered equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$
- The sum of $N$ across all tests won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
3
1 3 1
4
4 3 5 6
4
4 2 4 1

```

```
Yes
Yes
No

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The array is already a palindrome.

 **Test case $2$:**  Choose $X = 4$. This turns the array into $[5, 4, 4, 5]$ which is a palindrome.

 **Test case $3$:**  It can be verified that no value of $X$ will allow $A$ to be turned into a palindrome.

```py
# cook your dish here
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    c=0
    x=a[0]
    for i in range(1,n):
        if a[i]<=x:
            a[i]=a[i]+1
        else:
            a[i]=a[i]-1
        if a==a[::-1]:
            c=1
            break
        x=a[]
    if c:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
