## Problem

### Champagne Tower

Champagne glasses are arranged in a pyramid of $100$ rows. The first row contains $1$ glass, the second row contains $2$ glasses, and so on.

Each glass can hold at most  **1 cup**  of champagne.

Champagne is poured into the top glass. Whenever a glass contains more than $1$ cup, the excess champagne is divided equally between the two glasses directly below it.

Given the amount of champagne poured P and a glass at position $(R,C)$, determine how full that glass becomes.

Rows and glasses are  **0-indexed**, so the top glass is at $(0,0)$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains three space-separated integers $P$, $R$, and $C$ — the number of cups poured, the row of the queried glass, and its position in that row.
### Output Format
- Print a single floating-point number — how full the queried glass is, formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

The answer will always be between $0$ and $1$, inclusive.

### Constraints
- $0 \le P \le 10^9$
- $0 \le C \le R \lt 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4 2 0
```

```
0.25000
```

### Explanation:

After pouring $4$ cups, the two glasses in row $1$ each contain $1.5$ cups before overflow.

Each of them keeps $1$ cup and passes the remaining $0.5$ cup equally to the two glasses below.

Therefore, the glass at position $(2,0)$ receives $0.25$ cup and is  **$0.25$ full**.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
2 1 1
```

```
0.50000
```

### Explanation:

The top glass can hold only $1$ cup, so after pouring $2$ cups, $1$ cup overflows.

This excess champagne is divided equally between the two glasses in row $1$.

Therefore, the glass at position $(1,1)$ receives $0.5$ cup, so its fullness is: 0.50000
