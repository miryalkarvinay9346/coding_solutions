# Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return  *the  **number**  of strings in* `patterns` *that exist as a  **substring**  in* `word`.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= patterns.length <= 100
- 1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100
- 1 <= word.length <= 100
- patterns[i] and word consist of lowercase English letters.

        for i in patterns:
            if i in word:
                c+=1
        return c
```
