# Counting Words With a Given Prefix

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return  *the number of strings in* `words` *that contain* `pref` *as a  **prefix***.

A  **prefix**  of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100
- words[i] and pref consist of lowercase English letters.

                c+=1
        return c
