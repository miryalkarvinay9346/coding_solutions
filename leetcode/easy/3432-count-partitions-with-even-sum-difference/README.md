# Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A  **partition**  is defined as an index `i` where `0 <= i < n - 1`, splitting the array into two  **non-empty**  subarrays such that:

- Left subarray contains indices [0, i].
- Right subarray contains indices [i + 1, n - 1].

Return the number of  **partitions**  where the  **difference**  between the  **sum**  of the left and right subarrays is  **even**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [10,10,3,7,6]

 **Output:**  4

 **Explanation:** 

The 4 partitions are:

- [10], [10, 3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 10 - 26 = -16, which is even.
- [10, 10], [3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 20 - 16 = 4, which is even.
- [10, 10, 3], [7, 6] with a sum difference of 23 - 13 = 10, which is even.
- [10, 10, 3, 7], [6] with a sum difference of 30 - 6 = 24, which is even.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,2,2]

 **Output:**  0

 **Explanation:** 

No partition results in an even sum difference.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [2,4,6,8]

 **Output:**  3

 **Explanation:** 

All partitions result in an even sum difference.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= n == nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100

            b=nums[i:]
            if (sum(a)-sum(b))%2==0:
                c+=1
