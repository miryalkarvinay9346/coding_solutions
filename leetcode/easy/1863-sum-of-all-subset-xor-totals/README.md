# Sum of All Subset XOR Totals

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

The  **XOR total**  of an array is defined as the bitwise `XOR` of **all its elements**, or `0` if the array is **empty**.

- For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.

Given an array `nums`, return  *the  **sum**  of all  **XOR totals**  for every  **subset**  of* `nums`. 

 **Note:**  Subsets with the  **same**  elements should be counted  **multiple**  times.

An array `a` is a  **subset**  of an array `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `b`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [3] has an XOR total of 3.
- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.
0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [5,1,6]
Output: 28
Explanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [5] has an XOR total of 5.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [6] has an XOR total of 6.
- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.
- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.
- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.
- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.
0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 480
Explanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.

```
