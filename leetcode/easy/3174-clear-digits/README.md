# Clear Digits

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string `s`.

Your task is to remove  **all**  digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

- Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.

Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 **Note**  that the operation  *cannot*  be performed on a digit that does not have any non-digit character to its left.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  s = "abc"

 **Output:**  "abc"

 **Explanation:** 

There is no digit in the string.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  s = "cb34"

 **Output:**  ""

 **Explanation:** 

First, we apply the operation on `s[2]`, and `s` becomes `"c4"`.

Then we apply the operation on `s[1]`, and `s` becomes `""`.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
- The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(ch)
        return ''.join(stack)
        """
        s = list(s)
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i].isdigit():
                s.pop(i)      # remove digit
                s.pop(i - 1)  # remove character before it
                i -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
        return ''.join(s)
        """

```
