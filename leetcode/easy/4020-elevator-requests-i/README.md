# Elevator Requests I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `requests`, where `requests` represents the sequence of floor requests.

An elevator starts at floor 0 and follows these rules:

- The elevator moves one floor per second.
- The elevator serves requests in the given order.
- If the elevator is already on the requested floor, no movement is needed.
- After serving a request, the elevator immediately starts moving toward the next request.

Return the  **total time**  in seconds required to serve all requests.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 5, requests = [2,1,4,3]

 **Output:**  7

 **Explanation:** 

- requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
- requests[1] = 1: Moving from floor 2 to floor 1 takes 1 second.
- requests[2] = 4: Moving from floor 1 to floor 4 takes 3 seconds.
- requests[3] = 3: Moving from floor 4 to floor 3 takes 1 second.

The total time required is `2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7` seconds.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 3, requests = [2,0,0]

 **Output:**  4

 **Explanation:** 

- requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
- requests[1] = 0: Moving from floor 2 to floor 0 takes 2 seconds.
- requests[2] = 0: No movement is needed.

The total time required is `2 + 2 + 0 = 4` seconds.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 100
- 1 <= requests.length <= 100
- 0 <= requests[i] <= n - 1

        for i in range(1,len(requests)):
            m+=abs(requests[i]-requests[i-1])
        return m
