# Absolute Difference Between Maximum and Minimum K Elements

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the absolute difference between:

- the sum of the k largest elements in the array; and
- the sum of the k smallest elements in the array.

Return an integer denoting this difference.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [5,2,2,4], k = 2

 **Output:**  5

 **Explanation:** 

- The k = 2 largest elements are 4 and 5. Their sum is 4 + 5 = 9.
- The k = 2 smallest elements are 2 and 2. Their sum is 2 + 2 = 4.
- The absolute difference is abs(9 - 4) = 5.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [100], k = 1

 **Output:**  0

 **Explanation:** 

- The largest element is 100.
- The smallest element is 100.
- The absolute difference is abs(100 - 100) = 0.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n == nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
- 1 <= k <= n

    def absDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return abs(sum(nums[-k:])-sum(nums[:k]))
        
```
